Test data for --x-lsp with rust-analyzer (Rust language server).

The typed metavar pattern ($X: i32) should match expressions whose type
is 'i32' even when the type can only be determined by looking at the
definition in another file (lib.rs).

Prerequisites:
  - rust-analyzer:  rustup component add rust-analyzer
                    (or install from https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)
  - cargo/rustc:    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Setup:
  Build the project so rust-analyzer can index it:
    cd tests/lsp/rust && cargo check

Without --x-lsp (2 findings — only let bindings with implicit typed patterns):
  osemgrep scan -e '($X: i32)' --lang rust tests/lsp/rust/src/main.rs

With --x-lsp (8 findings — rust-analyzer resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --x-lsp --x-lsp-expr -e '($X: i32)' --lang rust tests/lsp/rust/src/main.rs

The 6 extra findings come from rust-analyzer knowing:
  - x: i32 has an explicit type annotation (line 14)
  - sum has type i32 (from add's return type defined in lib.rs)
  - add(x, 1) and its subexpressions return i32
  - sum in println!(..., sum, ...) has type i32
Without --x-lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve add's return type because it
is defined in lib.rs, not in main.rs.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
Cargo.toml) by walking upward from the target file. This is needed because
rust-analyzer requires the workspace root to match the Cargo project root.
