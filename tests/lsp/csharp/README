Test data for --lsp with OmniSharp (C# language server).

The typed metavar pattern (int $X) should match expressions whose type
is 'int' even when the type can only be determined by looking at the
definition in another file (Lib.cs).

Prerequisites:
  - OmniSharp: download from https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases
               extract to ~/.local/share/omnisharp/
  - dotnet:    apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0

Setup:
  Nothing to build — OmniSharp loads the project from test.csproj automatically.

Without --lsp (matches only literals and declared-type identifiers):
  osemgrep scan -e '(int $X)' --lang csharp tests/lsp/csharp/Main.cs

With --lsp (OmniSharp resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --lsp --lsp-expr -e '(int $X)' --lang csharp tests/lsp/csharp/Main.cs

The extra findings with --lsp come from OmniSharp knowing:
  - Lib.Add(a, b) has return type int (defined in Lib.cs)
  - sum has type int (from the declaration)
Without --lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve Lib.Add's return type because
it is defined in Lib.cs, not in Main.cs.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
*.csproj) by walking upward from the target file. This is needed because
OmniSharp requires the workspace root to find the project configuration.
