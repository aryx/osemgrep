Test data for --lsp with typescript-language-server (TypeScript/JavaScript).

The typed metavar pattern ($X : number) should match expressions whose
type is 'number', even when the type can only be determined by looking at
the definition in another file (lib.ts).

Note: TypeScript typed metavars use ($X : TYPE) syntax (like Java), not
$X as TYPE. The menhir JS parser has a special rule for this pattern.

Prerequisites:
  npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript

Setup:
  Nothing to build — typescript-language-server analyses TypeScript source directly.

Without --lsp (5 findings — only variables with explicit annotation):
  osemgrep scan -e '($X : number)' --lang ts tests/lsp/typescript/main.ts

With --lsp (9 findings — typescript-language-server resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --lsp --lsp-expr -e '($X : number)' --lang ts tests/lsp/typescript/main.ts

The 4 extra findings come from the type checker knowing:
  - result_num has type number (from add's return type defined in lib.ts)
  - x and result_num are number in additional expression contexts
Without --lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve add's return type because it
is defined in lib.ts, not in main.ts.

result_str correctly does NOT match because concat returns string,
not number.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
tsconfig.json) by walking upward from the target file. typescript-language-server
needs this to resolve imports correctly.
