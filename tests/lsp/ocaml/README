Test data for --x-lsp with ocamllsp (OCaml language server).

The typed metavar pattern ($X : int) should match expressions
whose type is 'int'. Without --x-lsp, semgrep only knows types
from explicit annotations. With --x-lsp, ocamllsp resolves inferred
types across modules (via .cmt files built by dune).

Setup (build the test project so ocamllsp has .cmt files):

  cd tests/lsp/ocaml
  dune build --root .

Usage (run from this directory):

  osemgrep scan --x-lsp --x-lsp-expr -e '($X : int)' -l ocaml main.ml

Expected results:
  Without --x-lsp:            6 findings  (syntactic matches only)
  With --x-lsp --x-lsp-expr:  8 findings  (ocamllsp resolves intermodule types)

Note: the dune-project file makes this a self-contained dune project
so that it does not interfere with the osemgrep build. ocamllsp uses
the PWD to find .merlin and .cmt files, so run from this directory.
