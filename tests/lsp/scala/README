Test data for --lsp with Metals (Scala language server).

The typed metavar pattern ($X: Int) should match expressions whose type
is 'Int' even when the type can only be determined by looking at the
definition in another file (Lib.scala).

Prerequisites:
  - JDK:       apt install default-jdk
  - coursier:  curl -fL "https://github.com/VirtusLab/coursier-m1/releases/latest/download/cs-aarch64-pc-linux.gz" | gzip -d > /tmp/cs && chmod +x /tmp/cs && /tmp/cs setup
               (for x86_64, replace "aarch64" with "x86_64" in the URL)
  - Metals:    cs install metals
  - sbt:       cs install sbt

Setup (first time only):
  1. Compile the project so sbt downloads dependencies:
       cd tests/lsp/scala && sbt compile && cd -
  2. Run osemgrep once with --timeout 60 to let Metals import the build.
     On first run, Metals sends a "Import build?" prompt which osemgrep
     accepts automatically. This triggers BSP connection + compilation
     which can take 20-60 seconds. The build metadata is cached in
     .metals/ and .bsp/ for subsequent runs.
       osemgrep scan --lsp --timeout 60 -e '($X: Int)' --lang scala tests/lsp/scala/Main.scala
  3. Subsequent runs are faster (~10s) since the build is already imported.

Without --lsp (matches only literals and declared-type identifiers):
  osemgrep scan -e '($X: Int)' --lang scala tests/lsp/scala/Main.scala

With --lsp (Metals resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --lsp --lsp-expr --timeout 60 -e '($X: Int)' --lang scala tests/lsp/scala/Main.scala

The extra findings with --lsp come from Metals knowing:
  - Lib.add(a, b) has return type Int (defined in Lib.scala)
  - sum has type Int (inferred from Lib.add's return type)
Without --lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve Lib.add's return type because
it is defined in Lib.scala, not in Main.scala.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
build.sbt) by walking upward from the target file. This is needed because
Metals requires the workspace root to find the build configuration.

Note: Metals needs warm-up time (especially on first run). Use --timeout 60
(or higher) to avoid the default 5-second per-file timeout from killing
the scan while Metals is still indexing.

Known quirk: Metals opens its "Doctor" status page in the browser each time
it starts (via xdg-open). This is a Metals behavior that cannot be suppressed
from the LSP client side. The page can be safely ignored/closed.
