Test data for --lsp with clangd (C++ language server).

The typed metavar pattern (int $X) should match expressions whose type
is 'int' even when the type can only be determined by:
  - looking at a class method declared in another file (math_utils.h)
  - resolving a template instantiation (identity<int>(x))
  - understanding 'auto' type deduction from interfile return types

Prerequisites:
  - clangd:  apt install clangd

Setup:
  Nothing to build — clangd uses heuristic fallback for simple projects
  with headers in the same directory.

  For larger projects, generate compile_commands.json:
    cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 .
  or with bear:
    bear -- make

Without --lsp (7 findings — only literals and identifiers with known types):
  osemgrep scan -e '(int $X)' --lang cpp tests/lsp/cpp/main.cpp

With --lsp (18 findings — clangd resolves interfile/template types):
  osemgrep scan --lsp --lsp-expr -e '(int $X)' --lang cpp tests/lsp/cpp/main.cpp

The 11 extra findings come from clangd knowing:
  - sum has type int (from MathUtils::add's return type in math_utils.h)
  - same has type int (from identity<int> template instantiation)
  - MathUtils::add and identity<int> return int
  - 'auto' variables sum and same are deduced as int
Without --lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve class method return types,
template instantiation types, or 'auto' deduction across files.
