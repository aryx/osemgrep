Test data for --lsp with jdtls (Eclipse JDT Language Server for Java).

The typed metavar pattern (int $X) should match expressions whose type
is 'int' even when the type can only be determined by looking at the
definition in another file (Lib.java).

Prerequisites:
  - jdtls:  apt install jdtls  (or download from https://eclipse.dev/jdtls/)
  - java:   apt install default-jdk

Setup:
  Nothing to build — jdtls loads the project from pom.xml automatically.

Without --lsp (matches only literals and declared-type identifiers):
  osemgrep scan -e '(int $X)' --lang java tests/lsp/java/Main.java

With --lsp (jdtls resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --lsp --lsp-expr -e '(int $X)' --lang java tests/lsp/java/Main.java

The extra findings with --lsp come from jdtls knowing:
  - Lib.add(a, b) has return type int (defined in Lib.java)
  - sum has type int (from the declaration)
Without --lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve Lib.add's return type because
it is defined in Lib.java, not in Main.java.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
pom.xml) by walking upward from the target file. This is needed because
jdtls requires the workspace root to find the project configuration.
