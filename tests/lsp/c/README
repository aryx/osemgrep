Test data for --x-lsp with clangd (C language server).

The typed metavar pattern (int $X) matches expressions whose type is
'int'. Without --x-lsp, semgrep only knows types from syntactic
declarations. With --x-lsp, clangd resolves types across files via
the header (lib.h), so e.g. add(x, 1) is recognized as int.

Usage (run from this directory):

  osemgrep scan --x-lsp --x-lsp-expr -e '(int $X)' -l c main.c

Expected results:
  Without --x-lsp:            8 findings  (syntactic types only)
  With --x-lsp --x-lsp-expr: 14 findings  (clangd resolves interfile types)

Note on compile_commands.json:
  clangd looks for a compile_commands.json to find compiler flags and
  include paths. For this simple test it is not needed — clangd's
  fallback heuristic finds lib.h because it is in the same directory.
  For larger projects with custom include paths or cross-directory
  headers, you would generate one (e.g. via bear, cmake, or meson)
  and place it at the project root. The "directory" field must be an
  absolute path for clangd to find it. Example:

  [
    {
      "directory": "/absolute/path/to/tests/lsp/c",
      "command": "cc -c lib.c -o lib.o",
      "file": "lib.c"
    },
    {
      "directory": "/absolute/path/to/tests/lsp/c",
      "command": "cc -c main.c -o main.o",
      "file": "main.c"
    }
  ]
