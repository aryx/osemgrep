Test data for --lsp with ty or pyright (Python language servers).

The typed metavar pattern show($X: int) should match calls to show()
where the argument's type is 'int', even when the type can only be
determined by looking at the definition in another file (lib.py).

Note: In Python, typed metavar patterns like ($X: int) must appear inside
an expression context (e.g. a function call argument) to be parsed as a
TypedMetavar node. A bare '$X: int' is parsed as a variable annotation
statement (DefStmt) instead.

Prerequisites (install one):
  - ty (recommended): uv tool install ty
                      (or: cargo install ty, or download from github.com/astral-sh/ty)
  - pyright:          npm install -g pyright
                      (or: pipx install pyright)

Setup:
  Nothing to build — ty and pyright analyse Python source directly.

Without --lsp (2 findings — only x with explicit annotation and literal 42):
  osemgrep scan -e 'show($X: int)' --lang python tests/lsp/python/main.py

With --lsp (3 findings — ty/pyright resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --lsp --lsp-expr -e 'show($X: int)' --lang python tests/lsp/python/main.py

The 1 extra finding comes from the type checker knowing:
  - result_int has type int (from add's return type defined in lib.py)
Without --lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve add's return type because it
is defined in lib.py, not in main.py.

show(result_float) correctly does NOT match because compute_ratio
returns float, not int.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
pyproject.toml) by walking upward from the target file. ty and pyright
both need this to resolve imports correctly.
