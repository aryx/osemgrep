Test data for --lsp with Intelephense (PHP language server).

The typed metavar pattern ($X: int) should match expressions whose type
is 'int' even when the type can only be determined by looking at the
definition in another file (Lib.php).

Prerequisites:
  - Node.js:       apt install nodejs npm
  - Intelephense:  npm install -g intelephense

Without --lsp (matches only literals and declared-type identifiers):
  osemgrep scan -e '($X: int)' --lang php tests/lsp/php/Main.php

With --lsp (Intelephense resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --lsp --lsp-expr --debug -e '($X: int)' --lang php tests/lsp/php/Main.php

The extra findings with --lsp come from Intelephense knowing:
  - Lib::add($a, $b) has return type int (defined in Lib.php)
  - $sum has type int (inferred from Lib::add's return type)
Without --lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve Lib::add's return type because
it is defined in Lib.php, not in Main.php.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
composer.json) by walking upward from the target file. This is needed
because Intelephense requires the workspace root.

Note: Intelephense needs warm-up time on first run. Use --timeout 30
(or higher) to avoid the default 5-second per-file timeout.
