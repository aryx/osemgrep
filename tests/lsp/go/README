Test data for --x-lsp with gopls (Go language server).

The typed metavar pattern ($X: int) should match expressions whose type
is 'int' even when the type can only be determined by looking at the
definition in another file (lib.go).

Prerequisites:
  - gopls:  go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
  - go:     apt install golang-go  (or from https://go.dev/dl/)

Setup:
  Nothing to build — gopls loads Go modules automatically from go.mod.

Without --x-lsp (6 findings — only literals and identifiers with known types):
  osemgrep scan -e '($X: int)' --lang go tests/lsp/go/main.go

With --x-lsp (10 findings — gopls resolves interfile types):
  osemgrep scan --x-lsp --x-lsp-expr -e '($X: int)' --lang go tests/lsp/go/main.go

The 4 extra findings come from gopls knowing:
  - sum has type int (from Add's return type defined in lib.go)
  - x := 42 is an int short declaration
  - sum := Add(x, 1) is an int short declaration
  - sum in fmt.Printf(..., sum, ...) has type int
Without --x-lsp, osemgrep cannot resolve Add's return type because it
is defined in lib.go, not in main.go.

Note: osemgrep automatically finds the project root (directory containing
go.mod) by walking upward from the target file. This is needed because
gopls requires the workspace root to match the Go module root.
