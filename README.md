OSemgrep is a fork of Semgrep keeping just the OCaml part
of the project (no Python wrapper like in the original Semgrep). 
Moreover, the focus is on the use of Jsonnet instead of Yaml
for the rules format (you can still use Yaml though).
Finally, the goal is to experiment with new features
such as LSP/SCIP integration for advanced semantic search
(e.g., using type information from LSP/SCIP), and 
especially to focus on improving OCaml and C support in Semgrep
(the two languages I am using for my main projects: XiX and Principia
Softwarica).
